# Dynamic Form, Interactive Data Table & Word Extraction

This repository contains code for implementing three different features:

1. **Dynamic Form Generation**: Allows users to dynamically add and remove form fields such as text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

2. **Interactive Data Table**: Creates an interactive data table where users can sort columns, filter rows, and paginate results efficiently.

3. **Extraction of Words**: A JavaScript program to extract words from a paragraph, highlighting words longer than eight characters.

## Dynamic Form Generation

The dynamic form generation feature provides a form builder interface where users can add and remove various form fields on the fly. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Interactive Data Table

The interactive data table feature allows users to interact with large datasets efficiently. Users can sort columns, filter rows, and paginate results to enhance the user experience. It is implemented using JavaScript to handle data manipulation and provide a smooth interface.

## Extraction of Words

This feature involves extracting words from a given paragraph and highlighting words longer than eight characters. It is implemented using JavaScript and provides a simple way to analyze text data.

Feel free to explore the code for each feature and adapt it to your own projects!
